## Usage

In your model, add `:lastseenable` module as such:

```rb

class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticable, ..., :lastseenable
end
```

## Configuration

Besides the column requirement you don't need customizations, but if you want to...

```rb
# config/initializers/devise.rb

Devise.setup do |config|
  ...

  # Interval (in seconds) to update the :last_seen_at_attribute attr
  # config.last_seen_at_interval = 5.minutes

  # Attribute who will be updated every time a user is set by the Warden's after_save callback
  # config.last_seen_at_attribute = :last_seen
end
```
